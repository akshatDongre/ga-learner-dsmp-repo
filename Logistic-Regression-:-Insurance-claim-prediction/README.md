The dataset has details of 1338 Insurance claim with 8 features.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I gained better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project, I predicted the Insurance claim using logistic regression. In this project, I applied the following concepts:

- Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Logistic Regression
- Auc score
- Roc AUC plot
