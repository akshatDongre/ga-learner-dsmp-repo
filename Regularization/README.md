### Project Overview

 Your friend from Iowa, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. He wants you to solve his Melbourne housing problem. Armed with your expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.

The dataset has details of 6830 house entries with the following 16 features.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I gained better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, I applied the following concepts.

- Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regressor
- Lasso Regressor
- Ridge Regressor
- R^2 Evaluation Metrics
